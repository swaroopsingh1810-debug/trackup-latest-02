// Supabase Edge Function: generate-outreach
//
// Generates a complete LinkedIn outreach FLOW for a lead, grounded in the user's
// own context. BYOK (Gemini / OpenAI / Anthropic). Deploy with verify_jwt OFF.
//
// The SHAPE of that flow is not decided here. The caller sends `steps`, derived
// from the method pack, and this function asks the model for exactly those keys.
//
// That indirection is the fix for a real defect: this function used to hardcode
// its own eight-key JSON shape while the pack described twelve differently-named
// steps. The model was told two different structures, and the validator then
// graded the response against keys nobody had asked for — reporting every step
// as "came back empty. Regenerate." on top of perfectly good copy. One contract,
// derived from the doctrine, is the only way that stays fixed.
