  # Case studies: the proof vault

  1. Why this is a table and not a textarea

     The method packs lean on proof harder than on anything else. Several laws
     depend on it: attach one concrete substantiating fact per claim, use at most
     ONE proof per message, match it to the reader's world, and never use a
     number that is not on record. A single free-text "wins" box cannot support
     any of that, the model gets everything at once and picks badly, or invents.

     Structured rows let the app hand the generator one matched proof, and let
     the validator check that every number in the output came from somewhere.

  2. The naming rule, encoded

     Client names are usable in proposals, discovery calls, DMs and email
     nurture, and NOT in public content or lead magnets. That is a per-case-study
     fact, not a global setting: some clients grant naming, some do not. So each
     row carries `naming` and an `anonymous_label` to fall back to
     ("a top-three consulting firm"). Generators pass the audience, and the app
     picks which form to send.

  3. Storage

     A PRIVATE `case-studies` bucket for the source document. Unlike proposals,
     these are never shared with anyone, so there is no public or signed-link
     path at all.

  Idempotent, safe to run more than once.
