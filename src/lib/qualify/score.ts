// Running the screen.
//
// Every point scored carries a reason, for the same purpose the proof selector
// does: a user has to be able to see why a lead was declined and disagree with
// it. A screen that returns a number nobody can argue with is a screen people
// route around.
//
// The one non-obvious rule is that "no" and "not checked yet" are kept apart all
// the way through. A lead nobody has researched must come back as `notYet` with
// the questions to answer, never as `decline` — otherwise the screen punishes
// the user for not having done the work it is about to ask them to do.
