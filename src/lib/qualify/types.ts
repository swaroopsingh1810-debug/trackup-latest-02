// Qualification and tiering.

// The step that runs BEFORE generation, and the one that makes Ember something
// other than a copy generator. A copy generator answers "what do I say to this
// lead?". This answers the two questions that come first:
//
//   1. Is this lead worth writing to at all?
//   2. If it is, how much of your effort has it earned?
//
// Both are commercial decisions, and both are already answered in the doctrine —
// the four-pillar screen with its two-of-four threshold, the impact/complexity
// quadrant, the buying ladder, and the tier split. Encoding them here means the
// app can decline a lead, which is the single behaviour a generator cannot have.
//
// The output is not just a verdict. It also constrains generation: a lead nobody
// researched must not receive a message claiming research, and a message to a
// problem-unaware reader has a different job than one to a reader already
// choosing between vendors.
