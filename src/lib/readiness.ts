// appeared to work, the app opened on an empty dashboard, and the first honest
// signal was a raw Postgres error inside a modal several screens later. Someone
// installing this on their own project has no way to tell a missing table from a
// bad paste from an RLS problem.
//
// So each check here answers a question the installer can act on, and every
// failure carries the specific fix rather than a status code.
