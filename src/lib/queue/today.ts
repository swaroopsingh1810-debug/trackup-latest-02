// What today is.
//
// Ember was a very good generator that a member visited once they had decided to
// do outreach. Deciding to do outreach is the thing this cohort does not do, so
// the decision has to be gone before the screen loads.
//
// Everything here is derived at read time from rows the app already holds. No
// queue table, no scheduler, nothing that can drift from the leads it describes:
// a member who imports fifty prospects and reloads sees them in the queue, and a
// member who marks four sent sees the queue shorten.
