// When each step is due.
//
// The packs have always carried a `day` on every outbound step, and the app
// threw it away — rendering "1 ·", "2 ·", "3 ·" and telling the operator the
// ORDER of four touches but never the SPACING. Order without spacing is a list;
// with spacing it is a sequence, and the difference is whether anyone can answer
// "who do I message today".
//
// Everything here is derived at read time from `sent_steps` and the pack. No
// scheduler, no stored due dates, nothing that can drift out of sync with a pack
// version. Nothing auto-sends either: every step is still copy-to-clipboard, so
// a wrong due date costs a glance, not a misfire.
