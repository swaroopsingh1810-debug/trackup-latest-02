  thesis: "Cold email reaches people who have never heard of you, in a medium built for one person writing to one other person. Its job is to earn a one-word reply, not to sell and not to book. It is the last link in a chain whose earlier links are sending infrastructure, the list, and the strength of the offer, which means excellent copy on a wide list or a weak offer still fails, while adequate copy on a narrow list with a strong offer works. Everything about the writing follows from that: plain enough for a fifteen-year-old, short enough to be read in a glance, led by their situation rather than your credentials, and carrying nothing a spam filter can hold against you, so no links, no images, no attachments, no formatting. It is not a newsletter, an ad, a landing page or a pitch deck, and it is not where a meeting gets booked. The meeting is asked for in the first human reply, after someone has shown interest. Before any of it is worth writing, the channel has to fit the offer at all.",

  knownTensions: [
    {
      "tension": "Sequence length. The primary cold email source caps a cold sequence at three emails and argues the fourth touch is worthless, while a delivered five-touch sequence built for a small, high-value market runs two touches past that cap and justifies it on the grounds that the prospect pool is finite and each name is worth a five-figure engagement.",
      "resolution": "Default to three. Where the pool is genuinely small, the source's own answer is not more touches but a resting list: re-sequence the same names in a fresh short campaign every two to three months, which multiplies a fixed universe several times over without adding exposures per prospect. Go to four or five only after that option has been taken and is still not enough, and record it as a deliberate departure rather than as method. The same source names a small market as a reason not to use the channel at all, so depth-instead-of-breadth is a wager, not an application of the doctrine."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Subject lines. One source says under three words, plain, no tricks, and stop optimizing. Another says do whatever it takes to get the email opened, even if it is hacky, because plausible deniability is your friend, and supplies '[firstName], question' as the template.",
      "resolution": "Plain wins, on the stronger evidence: hundreds of tested lines with negligible difference means a hacky line buys nothing and costs credibility with a careful reader. Never fabricate a 're:' in either direction."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Personalization. One source says relevance is manufactured upstream in list construction and that no AI or personalization hack rescues a wide list. Another reports reply rates moving from about 2 percent to 5 to 10 percent by generating an opening line per prospect, an average uplift of about 2.5x.",
      "resolution": "Both are true of different things. Build the list so that one specific true sentence exists for every name, then write that sentence. A generated icebreaker sitting on top of a wide, unsegmented list is exactly the case the first source rejects, and exactly the case the second source's uplift figure was not measured on."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Reply speed. One source says respond within the hour and shows a week-old interested reply as the counter-example. Another builds infrastructure for a five-minute reply and claims roughly 400 percent higher conversion at that speed. A delivered plan commits to two hours because the sender is in a different hemisphere from the buyer.",
      "resolution": "Commit to the fastest window you can actually sustain and then keep it. A kept two-hour commitment beats a broken one-hour commitment, and both beat an inbox nobody is watching."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Reply-rate benchmarks. One source sets the floor at 1 percent and calls 0.5 percent a deliverability failure. Another treats 4 to 5 percent as sufficient and shows campaigns at 4.8 to 11.6 percent.",
      "resolution": "They are different denominators, not different standards. The 1 percent floor is replies divided by emails sent; the 4 to 5 percent figures read as replies per prospect contacted, which is roughly the number of touches larger. Convert to sends before comparing anything, and expect your sending tool to report the inflated version."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Email length. The primary source wants 50 words over 100 and treats five to ten sentences as fatal. A delivered sequence written for a skeptical, long-tenured buyer runs every touch between 129 and 207 words, on the argument that the credibility purchase cannot be made in fifty words.",
      "resolution": "Do not concede and do not assume. The pack's ceilings are set at the doctrine, roughly 450 characters for email one, so a long version is a deliberate override rather than something the validator quietly permits. Write the short version and the long version of the first email and run them against each other; the compression must keep the observation line and the single hardest credibility clause and drop everything else. Whichever wins, the length is then defended by evidence rather than by argument."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Testing discipline against sample size. The doctrine says write at least two versions of email one and race them, and the source's own floor is roughly 2,000 to 3,000 prospects per variation. Most users of this pack will have a list an order of magnitude smaller than that.",
      "resolution": "Below a few thousand prospects per variation you are reading qualitative signal, not statistics. Still write two versions, because the alternative is a sequence nobody ever revisits, but do not declare a winner off a few hundred sends, do not diagnose anything before 3,000 sends, and where the list is genuinely too small to support a test the source says run one version and skip the test rather than pretend."

    {
      "tension": "Stopping on reply versus chasing an interested lead. One rule states absolutely that any reply pauses everything and no automated send ever goes to that address again. The other prescribes an automated two-step chase fired at leads who replied but never booked. Those cannot both stand as written.",
      "resolution": "Split the two systems, and let the split also carry the link ban. The cold sequence stops permanently on any reply, and no message sent before a reply carries a link. A separate interested-lead chase, tagged and tracked apart from the campaign, is permitted, always with the first response sent by hand, and a booking link is legitimate there because it sits inside a live conversation. Never run both against the same thread."
