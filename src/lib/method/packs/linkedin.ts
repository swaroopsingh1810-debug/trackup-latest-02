  thesis: "LinkedIn outreach is one person writing to one named person in a channel where the reader can see exactly who you are, check what you claim, and recognise instantly whether the same message went to four hundred other people. That makes it the wrong channel for volume and the right channel for precision: a connection request plus at most three short messages, each of which has to survive being read on a phone by someone who owes you nothing. It is not email in a different wrapper, there is no subject line to hide behind, the note is capped at a couple of sentences, a rejected request is a door that stays shut, and the account carrying all of it is your identity rather than a replaceable sending domain. This pack governs one job only: earning a first reply from a stranger, and handing the conversation to a human the moment one arrives. It is not for nurturing warm contacts, not for posting content, and not for anything after the reply, those are different activities with different rules, and applying cold-sequence doctrine to a live conversation is how good conversations get killed.",

  knownTensions: [
    {
      "tension": "Note or no note on the connection request. The invitation note is capped at 200 characters on free accounts and 300 on Premium, roughly one to two sentences, and the cap has moved before, so verify it on the account you are actually sending from. A note lets the observation line do its work before the reader ever decides whether to accept, and the sources are unanimous that the specific observation is the highest-value element available. But a note also lets a busy reader classify the request as sales and decline it, where a blank invite is often accepted on profile alone and preserves the observation for the first DM, where there is room to use it properly.",
      "resolution": "Write to 200 characters unless you have confirmed 300 on this account. Send the note only when the observation survives that limit intact and is genuinely specific, a fact about their business that took real research. Send the invite blank when the best you have would be truncated into a generic line, and spend the observation in the first DM instead. Never split an observation across the note and the first message; a compressed version in the note makes the full version read as a repeat."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Three cold messages versus five. The course doctrine caps cold outreach at three messages on the argument that interest is front-loaded and later touches accumulate complaints while returns fall. The worked practitioner sequence runs five touches and defends it on the grounds that a high-value, finite prospect pool justifies depth per prospect over breadth.",
      "resolution": "This pack takes three DMs after the connection request. Counting the request as a touch, that is four cold touches, one past the cited cap, and it is labelled here as a departure rather than an application. The reasons: LinkedIn's pool per operator is small, the reader can see every prior message in one scroll, and the cost of a block is permanent where a burned sending domain is replaceable. Never take it past four, and never add a fifth on the argument that the sequence permits it."
    },
    {
      "tension": "How many times to propose. The Cold Email Lab prescribes three to four specific slots in the prospect's own time zone with the calendar link as an \"if easier\" fallback. The six-month arc's meeting-rate lever prescribes two proposed times plus an explicit offer to work from their calendar. The sources genuinely disagree, and each pack previously resolved it silently and differently, so a user running email and LinkedIn side by side got two numbers from one app for one behaviour, attributed to nobody.",
      "resolution": "Three, everywhere: this pack, the email pack and the marketplace pack, with the arc's offer to work from their calendar carried alongside it and the link last. Three sits inside the Lab's stated band and one above the arc's, and the arc's real mechanism is the calendar offer rather than the count. Where you deviate, deviate consistently across channels rather than per pack."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Position of strength versus honesty about being early. One source instructs writing with no hedging and names \"I just started\" as a line never to use. Another instructs transparency about being early on the grounds that it removes the credibility gap instead of pretending past it, and converts inexperience from a liability into a reason to help you.",
      "resolution": "Never volunteer inexperience unprompted in a cold touch, it answers a question the reader has not asked. When they ask directly, answer in one forward-facing line with the offer attached rather than an apology. Transparency is a reply-branch move, not an opener."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Give something away versus give away your work. The strongest documented lever is an offer that is free or risk-reversed, handed over unconditionally. But an unconditional giveaway is also a full discount, and one source names discounting as a mistake because it concedes the value figure you just walked them through was inflated.",
      "resolution": "Give away something that is cheap for you to produce and expensive for them to obtain, a short list, one worked example, a teardown of something already public. Never give away the deliverable itself. If getting a lot of yeses would put you out of business, the giveaway is the wrong size."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Personalisation in the copy versus relevance in the list. The observation line is the highest-value element in any message, and hand-writing it is what makes the first touch work. But the course position is that relevance is manufactured upstream in list construction and that no personalisation technique rescues a badly built list.",
      "resolution": "Both, in order. Build the list around a reason for reaching out that will actually appear in the copy, a hiring signal, a new location, a published position, so the observation line has something true to draw on before you sit down to write it. Hand-write the line anyway. When observation lines start feeling forced, the list is the thing to fix, not the sentence."
    },
    {
      "tension": "Reply within the hour versus reply well. One source sets the standard at within the hour and another at five minutes, both on the argument that speed to lead dominates. Neither is achievable for an operator in a different time zone from their market, and a missed promise is worse than a slower one.",
      "resolution": "State a window you will actually hold and hold it. A kept two-hour commitment beats a broken one-hour commitment. What is not negotiable: the first reply is written by a human, and no reply goes unanswered past one business day in the reader's calendar."
