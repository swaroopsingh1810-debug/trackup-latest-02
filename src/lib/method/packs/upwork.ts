  thesis: "A marketplace proposal is a comparison document, not a pitch. The buyer has already decided the work is worth doing and has already decided a contractor is the answer, they posted the job and are now reading a stack of applications to settle one question: who do I pick? That single fact deletes most of what outreach copy normally does. There is no problem to establish, no category to explain, no permission to earn, no interruption to apologise for. What remains is differentiation under a truncated preview, against applicants who all claim the same competence, for a reader who is shortlisting rather than deliberating. This is also not a cold channel: asking for a call here is correct, where in cold email the same ask would be premature. And it is not free, every application costs connects and a hard fifteen-minute ceiling, so which jobs you decline is as much a part of the method as what you write. It also does not end when you press send: the buyer who replies is the most valuable reader you will get in this channel, and the method has to keep working after they do. What this channel is not: a place to introduce yourself, to educate the buyer about why the category matters, to advertise your tools, or to compete on price.",
